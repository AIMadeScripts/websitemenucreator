Currently it sort of works as it is.

To do:
1. Make sure if you have commands using quotes that we escape those correctly when parsing it into variable for os.system.
2. Look for identical menu options and alert the person they can't have identical menu names.


Example.py is included in this repository for understanding how the script should look in comparison.
The options used to generate example.py are as follows:


## Title: Scanner Script!
## 2 menu options
1. nmap -sV -sC $target
2. ping $target2
