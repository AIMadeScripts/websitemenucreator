Currently it sort of works as it is.

To do:
1. Make it check for if the user specified variables ($string) like $target in their command.
2. Make the functions name correctly.
3. Add the user input section to call on the functions.
4. Use variables to store the command for the os.system(command)
5. Don't allow for menu options with the same names. (would cause issues with finding what function to run)
